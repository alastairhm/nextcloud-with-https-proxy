# nextcloud-with-https-proxy
Nextcloud Personal cloud with https proxy

This is my configuration for creating a nextcloud server running with mariadb and a https proxy in front of it that passes all traffic from port 443 to the nextcloud instance running on port 80.

All images used in this project were the work of others and thank them in advance for their work.
